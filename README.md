# ETL-Project

The project must use two or more sources of data.

Recommended sources are data.world, Kaggle, or Google: https://toolbox.google.com/datasetsearch.

Alternatively, you may use APIs or scrape data from the web. However, if you chose to do this, you should run it by the instructional staff first.

Once datasets are identified, perform ETL on the data, and document the following in a technical report:


Datasets used and their sources.
  Github datasets of NFL play by play for two different years for the Kansas City Cheifs. 
  


Types of data wrangling performed, such as data cleaning, joining, filtering, and aggregating.
  Joining different NFL years
  


The schemata used in the final production database, whether relational or non-relational.  
  Postgresql (who setting up)
  What is the validation query to run
